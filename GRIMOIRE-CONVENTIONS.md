# Grimoire Conventions

Shared, load-bearing rules for the Grimoire workflow skills (`grimoire-init`, `grimoire-spec`, `grimoire-plan`, `grimoire-execute`, `grimoire-quick`). Each SKILL.md references this file as required reading. Do not duplicate these rules inside skill bodies — update them here.

The long-form pipeline is **Spec → Plan → Execute**: `grimoire-spec` gathers context and writes the page's `SPEC.md`, `grimoire-plan` reads that SPEC and writes the executable step files, `grimoire-execute` runs the step files. `grimoire-quick` is a separate fast-path that bypasses all three.

---

## § TDD

Every code change follows strict Red → Green → Refactor.

**CRITICAL:** NEVER execute the entire test suite. Use test filters (e.g., `--filter` in PHPUnit/Pest, `-k` in pytest, exact file paths in Jest/Vitest, etc.) to run ONLY the tests created or modified in the current step.

1. **Red:** Write or modify the tests for the current step. Run ONLY these tests and verify failure.
2. **Green:** Implement the minimum code needed. Run the same filtered tests again and verify they pass.
3. **Refactor:** Clean up the code while keeping the filtered tests green.

The same loop applies regardless of whether the work comes from `grimoire-plan`, `grimoire-execute`, or `grimoire-quick`.

---

## § Sub-agent spawning

The main context is an orchestrator. Implementation work runs inside sub-agents so the orchestrator's context stays lucid.

- **`grimoire-execute` on a page with one step file:** execute directly inside one sub-agent.
- **`grimoire-execute` on a page with multiple step files:** spawn one sub-agent **per step file**, in strict numeric order. Never start the next step until the current sub-agent has fully completed its assignment.
- **`grimoire-quick`:** spawn a single sub-agent for the entire fix once the user has authorized the inline plan.

Always instruct the sub-agent with the specific step file (or inline plan) it must execute, and require it to follow `§ TDD` and `§ Commits`.

---

## § Commits

- Make granular, atomic commits as work progresses.
- Commit immediately after each logical step completes (typically end of Green or Refactor).
- Use **Conventional Commits in English**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `style:`, `docs:`.
- One logical change per commit — do not bundle unrelated edits.
- `grimoire-spec` ends its run with two commits: `docs(grimoire): spec page <name>` for the new `SPEC.md` file, followed by `chore: register page <name> in historic` covering the new `HISTORIC.md` entry (and any rotation to `.grimoire/bag/historic/`).
- `grimoire-plan` ends its run with a `chore: mark page <name> planned` commit covering the in-place `HISTORIC.md` status update from `[spec]` to `[planned]`. This commit is separate from the step-file commit(s). `grimoire-plan` **never bootstraps, appends, or rotates** `HISTORIC.md`.
- `grimoire-execute` ends its run with a `chore: mark page <name> finished` commit covering the in-place `HISTORIC.md` status update from `[planned]` to `[finished]`. No files are moved on completion.

## § .grimoire/ layout

Every feature, change, or alteration tracked by Grimoire is a **page**. All pages live under `.grimoire/pages/` in the consuming project, regardless of whether they are planned, in progress, or finished. **There is no `.grimoire/finished/` directory** — status lives in `HISTORIC.md`, not in the filesystem.

**Page folder (mandatory for every page):**
- Path: `.grimoire/pages/NNN-[page-name]/` (e.g., `.grimoire/pages/001-user-auth/`).
- `NNN` is incremental and chronological across the whole project (`001`, `002`, `003`, …).
- The folder is **created by `grimoire-spec`** when the page is first specified. `grimoire-plan` and `grimoire-execute` never create page folders — they look up an existing one by number.

**Spec file inside a page folder:**
- `SPEC.md` at the root of the page folder describes the page in detail (Context, Goals, Non-goals, Scope, Acceptance criteria, Constraints, Open questions, References to code).
- Written by `grimoire-spec`; consumed by `grimoire-plan` as the source of truth for what to plan.
- A page without `SPEC.md` is not eligible for planning — `grimoire-plan` hard-stops if it is missing.

**Step files inside a page folder:**
- Always sequential, page-scoped numbering: `1-[step-name].md`, `2-[step-name].md`, `3-[step-name].md`, … (e.g., `1-schema.md`, `2-endpoints.md`, `3-tests.md`).
- A simple page has a single step file (`1-[step-name].md`); a larger page has multiple.
- Written by `grimoire-plan`. `grimoire-plan` chooses how many step files a page needs based on projected context lucidity per step.

**On completion (`grimoire-execute`):**
- The page folder, its `SPEC.md`, and its step files stay in place. **Nothing is moved.**
- The page's entry in `HISTORIC.md` is updated from `[planned]` to `[finished]`. See `§ Historic`.

**Project context file:**
- `.grimoire/PROJECT.md` — persistent project context generated and updated by `grimoire-init`. Loaded by every skill's `[Required Reading]` block. Not subject to `NNN-` numbering.

**Recent execution log:**
- `.grimoire/HISTORIC.md` — recency log and status-of-record for the last 5 pages. Bootstrapped, appended, and rotated by `grimoire-spec`; status-updated to `[planned]` by `grimoire-plan`; status-updated to `[finished]` by `grimoire-execute`. See `§ Historic`.
- `.grimoire/bag/historic/` — archive. When `HISTORIC.md` already has 5 entries and a new page must be added, the file is rotated here with a `HISTORIC-N.md` suffix before a fresh `HISTORIC.md` is started.

---

## § Project context

Every Grimoire skill loads `.grimoire/PROJECT.md` (if present) at the top of its `[Required Reading]` block so the orchestrator — and the sub-agents it spawns — share a baseline understanding of the project.

- **If `.grimoire/PROJECT.md` exists:** read it as project context before doing anything else.
- **If it does not exist:** proceed without it, and at the end of the run remind the user that running `grimoire-init` once will give future Grimoire sessions richer context. This is non-blocking — never refuse to work because `PROJECT.md` is missing.
- **`grimoire-init` is the only skill that writes `PROJECT.md`.** Other skills must not modify it as a side effect.
- **Update mode:** when `grimoire-init` is invoked and `.grimoire/PROJECT.md` already exists, it reads the existing file first and asks only about deltas (what has changed or is missing), then rewrites the file in place.

---

## § Historic

`.grimoire/HISTORIC.md` is both the recency log and the **status-of-record** for the most recent pages in the project. `.grimoire/bag/historic/` stores rotated snapshots of that log for older context.

**Entry format:**
```
N. **<page-name>** [spec|planned|finished] — <1–2 sentence description of what the page delivers>
```
Newest entry is item `1.`; older entries are renumbered downward. Status is one of `[spec]`, `[planned]`, or `[finished]`. The progression is strictly `[spec]` → `[planned]` → `[finished]`; statuses never move backwards and never skip a step.

**Write responsibilities (split across three skills):**

- **`grimoire-spec` — bootstrap, append, rotate.** Runs after the page folder and `SPEC.md` have been written. This is the **only** skill that creates entries, prepends entries, or rotates the file.
  - If `.grimoire/HISTORIC.md` **does not exist** → create it with the new page as entry `1.` with status `[spec]`.
  - If the entry for this page **already exists** (re-spec) → ensure its status is `[spec]` and refresh the description in place; do not duplicate and do not move its position.
  - If the entry does **not** exist and the file has **fewer than 5 entries** → prepend the new entry at the top with status `[spec]`, renumbering the previous ones.
  - If the entry does **not** exist and the file already has **5 entries** → **rotate first** (see below), then write a brand-new `HISTORIC.md` containing only the new entry as item `1.` with status `[spec]`.
- **`grimoire-plan` — status update only.** Runs after the step files have been written.
  - Find the entry whose `<page-name>` matches the planned page and update its status from `[spec]` to `[planned]` **in place** — do not change its position, do not append a new entry.
  - `grimoire-plan` **never appends new entries and never rotates**. If the matching entry is not in `[spec]` status (missing, `[planned]`, or `[finished]`), hard-stop per `§ Pause-point pattern` — never silently update.
- **`grimoire-execute` — status update only.** Runs after a successful execution of the page.
  - Find the entry whose `<page-name>` matches the executed page and update its status from `[planned]` to `[finished]` **in place** — do not change its position, do not append a new entry.
  - If the matching entry is not found (e.g., it was rotated away while the page was being executed), skip silently. This is non-blocking.
  - `grimoire-execute` **never appends new entries and never rotates**.

**Rotation (only triggered by `grimoire-spec`):**
- Create `.grimoire/bag/historic/` if it does not exist.
- Determine the next suffix: list names in `.grimoire/bag/historic/`, extract the `N` from `HISTORIC-N.md` files, and use `max(N) + 1`. If the folder is empty, use `N = 1`.
- Move `.grimoire/HISTORIC.md` to `.grimoire/bag/historic/HISTORIC-N.md`, then write a fresh `HISTORIC.md` with the new page as entry `1.`.

**How other skills consume it (read-only):**
- If `.grimoire/HISTORIC.md` exists, read it for recent-execution context and current status.
- If older context is relevant to the current task, browse `.grimoire/bag/historic/` in descending suffix order.
- Absence of the file is non-blocking for read-only consumers: proceed without recency context. (`grimoire-plan` and `grimoire-execute`, however, must hard-stop if the page they are asked to operate on has no matching entry — see `§ Pause-point pattern`.)

**Commits:**
- `grimoire-spec` ends with `chore: register page <name> in historic` covering the new entry (and any rotation) — see `§ Commits`.
- `grimoire-plan` ends with `chore: mark page <name> planned` covering the in-place `[spec]` → `[planned]` update — see `§ Commits`.
- `grimoire-execute` ends with `chore: mark page <name> finished` covering the in-place `[planned]` → `[finished]` update — see `§ Commits`.

## § IDE-aware review

When a skill must show the user a draft, plan, or other markdown content for review before proceeding (e.g., `PROJECT.md` draft, `SPEC.md` draft, `grimoire-quick` plan, `grimoire-update` changelog), prefer rendered markdown in the user's IDE over inline chat text. Inline chat text is hard to scan and has no markdown rendering; an open file in the IDE has both.

**Detection.** Inspect the runtime context for signals that Claude Code is running inside a desktop IDE extension (VSCode native extension, JetBrains plugin, Cursor, etc.). The system context block usually announces this explicitly (e.g., a `# VSCode Extension Context` section, or wording like *"running inside a VSCode native extension environment"*). When in doubt, assume terminal-only and use the inline fallback — the inline path is always safe.

**IDE-aware flow.**

1. Write the reviewable content to disk so the IDE auto-surfaces it with markdown preview:
   - `grimoire-init` → `.grimoire/PROJECT.md` (final destination).
   - `grimoire-spec` → `.grimoire/pages/NNN-[page-name]/SPEC.md` (create the page folder first if needed; do **not** touch `HISTORIC.md` yet — that still belongs to Phase 6).
   - `grimoire-quick` → `.grimoire/bag/drafts/quick-plan-<epoch>.md` (create the folder if needed; this is a throwaway draft, not a final artifact).
   - `grimoire-update` → `.grimoire/bag/drafts/grimoire-update-changelog-<epoch>.md` (same — throwaway).

   For the two ephemeral drafts above (`quick-plan`, `grimoire-update-changelog`), generate `<epoch>` as a Unix timestamp in seconds (`$(date +%s)`) at the moment of writing and memorize the resulting path for use during cleanup. This defeats the VSCode markdown preview cache, which keys on file path — without the suffix, a second invocation can show the stale preview from the prior run. The final-destination drafts (`PROJECT.md`, `SPEC.md`) keep their canonical names.
2. Tell the user in one short line which file was opened and what answer you're waiting for. Example: `📄 Rascunho aberto em .grimoire/PROJECT.md — revise no editor e diga "ok" para seguir, ou liste mudanças.`
3. PAUSE for the user's confirmation or edits — same semantics as the inline flow.
4. On approval:
   - `grimoire-init` / `grimoire-spec`: the file is already at the final path — proceed straight to the commit phase. **No additional Write step needed.**
   - `grimoire-quick` / `grimoire-update`: delete the draft file from `.grimoire/bag/drafts/` and proceed.
5. On requested edits: edit the file in place and re-pause.
6. On abandonment: delete the file (including the init/spec destination, since it was never approved — leaving an uncommitted, unapproved file pollutes the repo).

**Inline fallback (terminal-only).** When the IDE is not detected, paste the rendered draft inline in chat (legacy behavior). Pause semantics, approval gating, and downstream commit timing are identical to the IDE-aware flow.

**Commit timing.** Files written for review remain uncommitted until the user approves. The existing commit phases in each skill run unchanged AFTER approval — there is no separate "draft commit" and no cleanup commit.

## § Pause-point pattern

Grimoire skills must pause and wait for the user at well-defined checkpoints. Never proceed past a pause silently.

- **`grimoire-init` — clarifying questions:** after analyzing the codebase, ask the user only about facts that cannot be inferred from the code (purpose, audience, stage, non-obvious constraints). In update mode, ask only about deltas.
- **`grimoire-init` — draft review:** after composing the proposed `PROJECT.md`, present it for review per `§ IDE-aware review` and PAUSE for the user's confirmation or edits before locking the file in as approved.
- **`grimoire-spec` — clarifying questions:** after analyzing the codebase and the user's request, ask targeted questions about pain, ambiguities, scope, and critical architectural decisions. Answer the user's questions in turn. Iterate until a consensus on what the page must deliver is reached.
- **`grimoire-spec` — draft review:** after composing the proposed `SPEC.md`, present it for review per `§ IDE-aware review` and PAUSE for the user's confirmation or edits before locking the file in as approved. Do not write or touch `HISTORIC.md` yet.
- **`grimoire-plan` — precondition check (HARD STOP):** before doing anything else, resolve the page number to `.grimoire/pages/NNN-*/`. If the folder does not exist, if `SPEC.md` is missing, or if the entry's status in `HISTORIC.md` is not `[spec]`, STOP immediately with a clear message naming the current state and the skill the user should run instead. Never offer to run that skill automatically; never silently fix the state.
  - Page NNN does not exist → `❌ Page NNN não existe. Rode /grimoire-spec primeiro.`
  - `SPEC.md` missing → `❌ Page NNN não tem SPEC.md. Rode /grimoire-spec primeiro.`
  - Status is `[planned]` → `❌ Page NNN já foi planejada.`
  - Status is `[finished]` → `❌ Page NNN já foi finalizada.`
  - Entry missing from `HISTORIC.md` (rotated or never registered) → `❌ Page NNN não está registrada no HISTORIC. Rode /grimoire-spec primeiro.`
- **`grimoire-plan` — unclear requirements:** after the precondition passes and the SPEC has been read, if a critical architectural decision is still ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before writing step files.
- **`grimoire-execute` — precondition check (HARD STOP):** before doing anything else, resolve the page number to `.grimoire/pages/NNN-*/`. If the folder does not exist, if no step file (`1-*.md`) is present, or if the entry's status in `HISTORIC.md` is not `[planned]`, STOP immediately with a clear message. Never offer to run another skill automatically; never silently fix the state.
  - Page NNN does not exist → `❌ Page NNN não existe.`
  - No step files in the folder → `❌ Page NNN ainda não tem plano. Rode /grimoire-plan NNN primeiro.`
  - Status is `[spec]` → `❌ Page NNN ainda está em spec. Rode /grimoire-plan NNN primeiro.`
  - Status is `[finished]` → `❌ Page NNN já foi finalizada.`
  - Entry missing from `HISTORIC.md` (rotated) → proceed; this matches the existing "skip silently if rotated" rule in `§ Historic` because rotation can happen during long executions.
- **`grimoire-quick` — scope gatekeeper:** if the request is too large/complex to fit a quick execution, STOP immediately and tell the user to switch to `grimoire-spec` (the entry point to the long-form Spec → Plan → Execute pipeline) instead of generating a plan.
- **`grimoire-quick` — plan authorization:** after presenting the plan for review per `§ IDE-aware review`, PAUSE and wait for the user's explicit authorization or corrections before spawning the sub-agent. Do not start coding yet.
